One by one, the user inputs employees of 3 types: Manager, Engineer, and Intern. The prompts ask for information about each employee, some of which is dependant on the position chosen. Once the user is done entering their choices, the appication automatically generates an HTML file (with corresponding CSS) for displaying their employee roster.
